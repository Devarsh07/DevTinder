1) Ek middleware se dusre middleware jane ke liye humein next() function ko call karna hi padega.
2)If we use multiple Request Handlers in a single Middleware/routes then we have only send a response from one of the request handlers , we cant able to send multiple responses from the single middleware.
3) app.use("/route",rH1,rH2,rH3,rH4);
4)we can make array of any one , two , three or all in one array like and all give same results , below;
app.use("/route",rH1,[rH2,rH3],rH4) --(i)
app.use("/route",rH1,rH2,rH3,[rH4]) --(ii)
app.use("/route",[rH1,rH2,rH3,rH4]) --(iii)

here i,ii,iii all are giveing the same responses/results.

5)what is Middleware? is a funtion which perform any changes or action on the comming requests through a callback function.
6)What is Middlewares? Middlewares is chain of callback function(one after the other) which performs some changes on the requests comming from the client,
 - and after completeion of all functions the last callback functions sending the response . 
 And this last or the any one which send the respond is called the request handler function.
7)Request Handler function is the function which handled the request and then send the response as per the request received.
8) jahaan bhi request mein changes ho rhe hai or jahaan bhi next() samajh le wo middleware hai.
9)when we use app.use for middleware/route handler it mean its checked the given route only while the route has some sub routes-
 - its only checked the route used in app.use middleware.But in case of app.all the incomming routes must be same as route used-
 - in the app.all , aur ye dono hi all type of incomming request ko support karte hai bhale hi wo GET,PUT,PATCH ... ok.
